As HakuNeko is growing and nobody is reading the wiki pages on the github, this new site (kindly hosted by github) will try to give a quick overview of what hakuneko is in a more -sexy way-.

The domain hakuneko.download will be the official homepage, but we know that for a while many links will point directly to the github. If you want to spread the love around HakuNeko use the new URL : [https://hakuneko.download](https://hakuneko.download)
